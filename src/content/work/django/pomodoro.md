- GitHub Code - <a href="https://github.com/Gopal-Khadka/SaaS-App-Using-Django" target="_blank">Link</a>

#### What is PomoSuperFocus?

PomoSuperFocus is an all-in-one productivity tool that combines Pomodoro timers, habit tracking, goal setting, to-do lists, and more, all in one platform. It's designed to help users stay organized, track progress, and boost productivity seamlessly.

#### The Tech Stack

For the backend, we’re using **Django** to manage the app’s logic and functionality. We’ve chosen **Neon** with **PostgreSQL** for a reliable and scalable database. For the frontend, we’re using **Tailwind CSS** and **Flowbite** for sleek, modern design. **HTMX** and **Alpine JS** are used to add interactivity and dynamic content, while **Stripe** will handle payments for premium features.

#### Features Overview

- **Pomodoro Timer**: Customizable study and break times, complete with background music integration.
- **Task Management**: The Eisenhower Matrix helps you prioritize tasks efficiently.
- **Habits Scorecard**: Inspired by James Clear’s *Atomic Habits*, track your habits and stay on top of your goals.
- **Goal Setting**: Create and manage goals using Himesh Madan’s practical approach.
- **Working Framework**: Craft a personal productivity formula to boost success.
- **Gratitude & Bucket Lists**: Focus on what you’re grateful for and track your dreams and goals.

#### Why This Stack?

We’ve carefully chosen this stack to ensure scalability, flexibility, and a smooth user experience. **Django** allows for rapid development, **Postgres** offers powerful data management, and **Tailwind + Flowbite** make it easy to create an attractive and responsive UI. **HTMX** and **Alpine JS** add lightweight interactivity without complex front-end frameworks, and **Stripe** makes payment processing simple and secure.

#### The Road Ahead

PomoSuperFocus is still in development, and we’re excited to share new features in the coming months. As we grow, we’ll continue to improve the app's performance and introduce even more productivity tools.

#### Get Involved

PomoSuperFocus is built with love and passion for productivity. If you’d like to support our journey or want early access to premium features, feel free to reach out. We’re committed to building a tool that truly helps people manage their time and achieve their goals!
