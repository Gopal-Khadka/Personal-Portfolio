The Django Student Management System is a web application developed for educational purposes, providing an efficient way to manage students, staff, courses, attendance, and more. Built using the powerful Python framework, Django, this system allows users to perform various administrative tasks and ensures smooth interaction between students, staff, and administrators.

**Features of the System**

For **Admin Users**, the system provides a comprehensive overview, allowing them to access detailed charts of student and staff performances, courses, subjects, attendance, and leave statuses. Admins can manage staff and student information, including adding, updating, or deleting records. They can also manage courses, subjects, and sessions, ensuring everything runs smoothly. Additionally, admins have the ability to view student attendance, respond to feedback, and review or approve leave requests.

**Staff/Teachers** benefit from the system by being able to view summary charts related to their students, their subjects, and leave statuses. Teachers can take and update student attendance, as well as input and update student results. They can also apply for leave and send feedback directly to the Head of Department (HOD).

For **Students**, the system offers a user-friendly interface where they can view charts related to their attendance and subjects. Students can easily check their attendance, view their results, apply for leave, and send feedback to the HOD. This ensures that students have a transparent view of their academic performance and can easily manage their schedules.

**Libraries and Tools Used**

The Django Student Management System leverages several powerful libraries and tools to enhance user experience and functionality. **Django** serves as the core framework for building the backend, providing a robust foundation for the application. **Font Awesome** and **Ionicons** are used for incorporating scalable vector icons throughout the interface, while **Tempusdominus** offers a smooth date and time picker for easier scheduling.

**iCheck** customizes the appearance of checkboxes and radio buttons, and **JQVMap** allows the embedding of interactive maps to display location-based data. The system uses **AdminLTE**, a responsive dashboard template that simplifies creating modern administrative interfaces. Additionally, **OverlayScrollbars** and **Daterangepicker** improve the visual appearance and functionality of scrollable areas and date range selections, respectively. Finally, **Summernote**, a WYSIWYG editor, is included for adding rich content, and **Google Fonts** provides modern typography for a sleek user experience.
